## Fleet Sampling

As your fleet grows, it becomes more costly to send, process and store the data
from all devices in growing fleets. With the Fleet Sampling feature, Memfault
helps manage the costs for your device data bandwidth by only collecting
diagnostics and performance data from a smaller, yet statistically significant,
subset of a fleet that you can control at any time.

Thanks to [Chart Normalization](/docs/platform/charts/#chart-normalization), all
insights to understand issues occurring across your fleet will still be at your
disposal even when a only smaller number of devices are reporting from the
field. For more information, please refer to the
[Fleet Sampling documentation](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling/).

## Best Practices: Low-Bandwidth Devices

Memfault was built from the ground up to handle devices with limited bandwidth,
intermittent connectivity, and minimal processing power capabilities. Following
the guidelines and code examples in the recently published
[Using Memfault with Low-Bandwidth Devices](/docs/best-practices/low-bandwidth-devices/)
article, IoT operators can save on network costs and lower the power consumption
of their devices.

## General

- Added:
  [Documentation on best practices when using Memfault with low-bandwidth devices](/docs/best-practices/low-bandwidth-devices)
- Added:
  [Documentation of Fleet Sampling feature](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling)
- Added: UI feedback under Issue Details page in the case of malformed log data
- Improved: Various UI glitches and improvements (Improved error messages when
  Fleet Sampling quotas are reached, device serial is invalid or
  [Symbol File](/docs/mcu/symbol-file-build-ids/) is missing, matching the bar
  colors of Reboot Reasons chart with the colors of the labels in the legend)
- Improved: Displaying Trace title instead of the Issue title under Issue
  Details page as they may differ
- Improved: Re-processing logic works on viewed trace instead of the most recent
  trace
- Fixed: Glitches when processing Qualcomm crash reports (Certain crash reports
  not getting processed, error when uploading a report with no events, filtering
  out events containing only a few small memory regions)
- Fixed: Aborting a staged OTA rollout for large fleets could fail
- Fixed: Metric search in Device Timeline not returning any results
- Fixed: Incorrect parsing of negative metric ranges
- Fixed: Possible timeouts/performance issues when uploading symbol files in
  projects with a large number of software versions
- Fixed: Broken formatting of
  [Slack notifications](/docs/platform/notifications) for
  [Device Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts) when the alert had a special character
  in its title
- Fixed: Normalized
  [Metric and Issue charts](/docs/platform/charts#metric-charts) showing data
  only for the past two weeks
- Changed: Showing Trace title instead of message under Issue Detail â†’ Recent
  Traces
- Changed: Top & New Issues Charts no longer take Issues with no recent Traces
  into account
- Changed: Received Traces chart under Overview page no longer takes Traces with
  future dates into account
- Changed: Received Traces chart now only shows the data received and occurred
  within the last 14 days or 8 weeks, instead of received within the last 14
  days and occurred over all time

## MCU

- Fixed: Coredump processing failures due to corrupted log buffers
- SDK versions
  [0.36.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0360-and-sdk-0350---dec-6-2022),
  [0.36.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0361-and-sdk-0360---dec-9-2022)
  and
  [0.37.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0370-and-sdk-0361---dec-16-2022)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Support for
    [just-released ESP-IDF v5](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/tag/v5.0)
    (Thanks [@jlubawy](https://github.com/jlubawy) for the patch)
  - Added: Auto-OTA (and auto-WiFi-join) feature to the
    [ESP32 example app](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/esp32)
  - Added: `MemfaultSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur` metric for tracking
    crash-free hours

## Android

- Added: Support for [Device and Fleet level alerts](/docs/platform/alerts)
- Improved: Logcat processing failing when a row with a UTF-8 encoding issue
  encountered
- We did not publish a new version of the
  [Android Bort AOSP SDK](https://github.com/memfault/bort) in December.

## Linux

- Changed: Filtering out Traces with archived software versions under Issues
  page
- SDK version
  [1.2.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/kirkstone/CHANGELOG.md#120---2022-12-26)
  was released. Some highlights:
  - Added:
    [New `memfaultctl` command](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli/#memfaultctl-commands)
    to interact with `memfaultd`
  - Added:
    [Developer Mode](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli/#developer-mode) to
    reduce rate limits applied to coredump uploads during development
  - Added: Support for running the Docker container on Apple silicon without
    Rosetta emulation
  - Improved: Coredump compression with gzip to reduce storage and network usage
  - Fixed: `swupdate` getting into a bad state after reloading `memfaultd`
  - Changed: `memfaultd --(enable|disable)-dev-collection` and `memfaultctl -s`
    are now replaced by equivalent commands on `memfaultctl` and will be removed
    in a future version

## CLI

- We did not publish a new version of the
  [memfault-cli](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/) in December.
