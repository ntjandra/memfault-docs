## Including Linked Devices in the Search Results

With the introduction of the
[Linked Device](/docs/platform/inspecting-a-device/#linked-devices) Search
feature, users can not only list the devices returned by search results, but
also the devices that are linked to those devices. This is helpful when defining
a population of devices (both primary and linked) before performing follow-up
tasks such as assigning them to a specific
[Cohort](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology/#cohort), describing a new Device
Set or assigning [Fleet Sampling Resolutions](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling) and
while doing so preventing any discrepancies (e.g. linked device staying in the
old [Cohort](/docs/platform/memfault-terminology/#cohort) while the primary
device is moved to a new one). Improvements to the Device Details page will also
allow users to easily inspect the configuration states and update the Fleet
Sampling Resolutions of both devices.
