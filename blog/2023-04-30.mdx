## Server-Side Support for Developer Mode

Developer Mode now allows you to temporarily remove any server-side rate
limiting on devices from within the device view. This new functionality gives
you full control over your integration/testing process with no imposed
requirement to pause or prematurely switch between devices because a rate limit
has been hit.

This will make it easier to integrate, configure and test new Memfault features
and accelerate the testing, debugging and feature development processes of your
own products using Memfault.

Developer Mode is activated on a per-device basis and will remove all rate
limiting for uploads from the device to Memfault of coredumps, bug reports,
heartbeats and other data. This
[Server-Side Developer Mode](/docs/platform/rate-limiting/#server-side-developer-mode)
functionality is an extension of the existing device-side Developer Mode
([Android](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#developer-mode-since-bort-420),
[Linux](/docs/linux/reference-memfaultctl-cli/#developer-mode)) and they can be
used in tandem or independently.

## Memfault Support for Cortex-R

Memfault has expanded its coverage of Arm-based devices adding support for
coredumps on Arm Cortex-R. This allows customers to realize the full value of
the Memfault monitoring, debugging and update capabilities on more of their
Arm-based devices.

For customers already familiar with integrating the Memfault Firmware SDK on
Cortex-M devices, the process for Cortex-R-based devices is very similar, with
the only minor difference in the integration of the exception/interrupt handlers
on Cortex-R. For more information on how to complete the integration, please
review our [Arm Cortex-R integration guide](/docs/mcu/arm-cortex-r-guide).

  page and Issue Distribution Charts under Issue Details
- Fixed: Problems accessing project’s resources when a user is assigned multiple
  roles via
  [Memfault’s Access Control](/docs/platform/access-control-teams-roles/)
- Fixed: Users of projects created by Memfault support staff can’t access
  project resources
- Fixed: Missing “Download” option for some Qualcomm traces

## MCU

- Added:
  [Support for casting to pointer types](/docs/platform/trace-details#type-casting)
  under Trace Details → Globals/Statics
- SDK versions
  [0.42.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0421-and-0420---april-4-2023),
  [0.43.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0430-and-0421---april-18-2023)

  [0.43.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0431-and-0430---april-26-2023)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added:
    [Coredump support for Cortex-R chips (ARMv7-R)](/docs/mcu/arm-cortex-r-guide)
  - Added:
    [A QEMU-based FreeRTOS example project](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/freertos)
  - Added: (Zephyr port) Support for showing high watermark information in the
    Memfault coredump analysis view without capturing the full stack for a
    thread
  - Changed: The `z_NmiHandlerSet` function is renamed for the upcoming Zephyr
    3.4. Thanks [@mbolivar-nordic](https://github.com/mbolivar-nordic) for the
    patch!

## Android

    [MAR](https://mflt.io/android-mar) is now the only supported upload
    mechanism.
  - Changed: When using
    [Client-Server mode](/docs/android/android-multi-device-support/#client-server-mode),
    limit the age and retry count of files waiting to be transferred to the
    Server device in UsageReporter.

## Linux
