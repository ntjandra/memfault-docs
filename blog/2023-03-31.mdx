## New Access Control Permissions: Teams and Roles

Memfault added new concepts for access control: Teams are a flexible way to
group members of an organization. They can reflect an actual company structure
with functions such as “quality assurance” or “firmware engineering.”
Alternatively, with Roles, administrators can design teams solely to manage
permissions more conveniently when assigning dedicated roles on a per-project
level.

[Teams and Roles allow for configuration scenarios](/docs/platform/access-control-teams-roles#configuration-examples)
such as “read-only access for this department” or “OTA must only ever be
performed by these four people.” They further allow for sophisticated setups
such as “these five contractors may only ever see this one project and nothing
else” or “newly invited members of the organization can do anything with our
playground project but are otherwise limited to read-only access.”

Using this new system is strictly optional as all members of an organization are
part of the group “everyone” that grants permission to all of Memfault’s
features by default.

## General

- Added: Support for devices to update their
  [`hardware_version`](/docs/platform/software-version-hardware-version/#hardware-version)
- Added:
  [Support for ignoring a “Range” of invalid metric values for fleet-wide aggregations](/docs/platform/metrics/#range),
  [Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts/) and Device Timeline under _Settings → Metrics
  → Edit Metric → Range_
- Fixed: Missing `MemfaultSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur` metric in the
  [Metric Chart](/docs/platform/charts/#metric-charts) dropdown
- Fixed: Setting `MemfaultSdkMetric_UnexpectedRebootDidOccur` as
  [Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics/#timeseries) not possible
- Fixed: [Issue Charts](/docs/platform/charts/#issue-charts) Filters using the
  first software version available in the dropdown instead of the selected value
- Fixed: UI glitches (not possible to dismiss Edit Metric modal, Edit Metric
  modal sometimes showing up empty, opening docs on loading coredumps into GDB
  in a new tab)
- Changed: Number of use invites via
  [Admin → Invites](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/settings/invites)
  that can be sent at once is limited to 50

SDK versions
[0.41.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0411-and-sdk-0410---mar-1-2023),
[0.41.2](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0412-and-sdk-0411---mar-10-2023),
[0.42.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/CHANGES.md#changes-between-memfault-sdk-0420-and-0412---mar-22-2023)
were released. Some highlights:

- Added: Capturing all of RAM in a coredump as an option to the
  [examples/nrf-connect/nrf5](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/tree/master/examples/nrf-connect-sdk/nrf5)
- Added: Option to capture full thread stacks for classifying stack overflows
  and determining stack high watermarks.
- Improved: Quality of life improvements for
  [scripts/memfault_gdb.py](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/scripts/memfault_gdb.py)
  (Support for exporting data from GCC 12 compiled symbol files and arguments to
  override device serial ID, software type, software version, and hardware
  revision)
- Fixed: Issue in Memfault Logging backend causing coredump saving to fail when
  building with Zephyr versions before 3.0 (nRF-Connect SDK < 2.0)
- Fixed: Compilation error in the
  [ESP32 example app](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/master/examples/esp32)
  when targeting ESP-IDF >=4.4,<4.4.3
- Changed: Integer-type metrics (signed/unsigned) will reset to NULL when not
  set during a heartbeat interval. See
  [SDK documentation](/docs/mcu/metrics-api/#setting-metric-values) for further
  information.

## Android

- Added: Support for updating `hardware_version` with the value in the MAR files
- SDK version
  [4.5.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v450---march-27th-2023)
  of the Android Bort SDK was released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Metric for [Fleet Sampling](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling/)
    resolutions
  - Added: Support for changing the project key at runtime via
    [intent broadcast](/docs/android/android-bort/#setting-project-key-at-runtime)
  - Improved: All on-device rate limits can now be bypassed via
    [Dev Mode](/docs/android/android-getting-started-guide/#development-mode-since-bort-420)
    (previously only WTF rate limits)
  - Fixed: Socket error when running in
    [Client/Server mode](/docs/android/android-multi-device-support#client-server-mode)
  - Fixed: MemfaultDumpster crash when
    [Continuous Logging Mode](/docs/android/android-logging/#continuous) enabled
  - Changed: Limit max storage age of MAR files to 7 days (down from 30)

## Linux

- Added: [Documentation on logging](/docs/linux/logging)
- Added:
  [Documentation on pre-linking](/docs/linux/coredumps/#make-sure-prelinking-is-disabled)
- SDK versions
  [1.3.0](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/kirkstone/CHANGELOG.md#130---2023-03-06)
  and
  [1.3.1](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/blob/kirkstone/CHANGELOG.md#131---2023-03-22)
  were released. Some highlights:
  - Added: Support for MAR files,
    [also used in Bort SDK](/docs/android/uploading-android-diagnostics/#uploading-a-mar-file).
  - Added: [Preview version of log collection](/docs/linux/logging/)
  - Added: Log collection example in
    [`meta-memfault-example`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/tree/kirkstone/meta-memfault-example)
  - Added: Configuration in
    [`meta-memfault-example`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-linux-sdk/tree/kirkstone/meta-memfault-example)
    to run on Raspberry Pi 2/3/4
  - Added: Collection of coredumps of `memfaultd`
  - Fixed: Crash in coredump capturing code in case more than 16 warnings got
    emitted during the capture process. Thanks to
    [@attilaszia](https://github.com/attilaszia) for reporting this issue!
  - Changed: Yocto layer now requires Cargo and Rust 1.65.0 as the SDK is
    partially written in Rust

## CLI

- We did not publish a new version of the
  [memfault-cli](https://pypi.org/project/memfault-cli/) in March.
