During the event of a core dump, your device will log an issue and send it to Memfault where it will be analyzed. 
Once the core dump is analyzed, it will be available on the Memfault's web app and ready for inspection as an issue. 
These issues are tracked on the Smart Sink Issues Dashboard containing information on system processes, device state, and logs.

The web app provides an interface to help you inspect these issues in fine detail by breaking down the events.
- Device Overview: Inspect high-level causes from version changes as a software or hardware malfunction.
- Core Dump: Download the raw core dump to debug it locally with GDB.
- Threads and Processes: Dive deep into the intricasies of what happened before the crash.
- Data captures: Analyze the state of the variables and memory address at each stage of the crash.
- Console logs: Inspect logs created by programs running and system services.

## Thread Panel

The thread panel is located on the bottom left, under the capture details.
The panel contains a list of threads and is used to trace back the event log of each individual process associated with the core dump.

### Call Stack
The panel consists of the call stack, which can be opened to see it's children processes. By following the tree-like structure you're able to dive deeper into the cause of the issue.

### Tags
Each thread captured by Memfault is automatically tagged based on the event analysis of Memfault.
There are two types of tags: state tags and causal tags. Each tag can only be assigned one per event.

#### State Tags
State tags are represent the system state of the thread in charge of the device process.

The state tags are broken down as:
- Suspended: The thread has been canceled either due to an error or interupt.
- Blocked: The thread is unable to run and waiting for another process to finish.
- Running: The thread is currently working, and is running.
- Ready: The thread is ready to run and idle, waiting for a task to be given.

These tags are useful for determining which process to start inspecting first. You're more likely to find an issue in a suspended process, rather than a ready or blocked process.

#### Causal Tags
During the analysis of a core dump, Memfault may find the root cause immediately and tag it.

Here are some issues Memfault can auto detect:
- Stack Overflow: An error has occured where a variable stores more data than the memory allocated.
