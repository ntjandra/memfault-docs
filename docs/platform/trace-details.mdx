To get a deeper understanding of an Issue, one can view the details of a Trace
under the "Details" tab of an Issue:

![](/img/docs/platform/trace-details.png)

Depending on the configuration of the Memfault SDK and what is available on your
platform, the Trace Details tab shows:

|                             | MCU | Android | Linux |
| --------------------------- | --- | ------- | ----- |
| Exceptions Info             | ✅  | ✅      | ✅    |
| Logs                        | ✅  | ✅      | ✅    |
| Threads & Backtraces        | ✅  | ✅      | ✅    |
| Registers & Local variables | ✅  |         | ✅    |
| Memory Viewer               | ✅  |         | ✅    |
| Global & Static variables   | ✅  |         |       |

## Exceptions Info

The Exceptions tab shows an analysis of the exception that occurred. For
example, for MCU projects on an ARM microcontroller, the fault registers are
decoded by Memfault and presented in a human-readable way:

  src="/img/docs/platform/trace-details-exception-info-hardfault.png"
  alt="logs-with-coredump"
/>

## Logs

The Logs tab will display logs that are pertinent to the Trace. See these guides
for more information on how to configure the Memfault SDK to collect logs:

- [MCU logging](/docs/mcu/logging/)
- [Android logging](/docs/android/android-logging)
- [Linux logging](/docs/linux/logging)

  alt="logs-with-coredump"
/>

## Threads & Backtraces

The Threads tab will display information about the threads that were running
when the Trace was captured.

The first thread in the list is always the thread that caused the Trace to be
captured. The chevron in front of the thread name can be clicked to reveal the
backtrace, consisting of the stack frames (function calls) that lead up to the
state of the thread. Each stack frame also has a chevron to reveal more metadata
on the frame, such as the full source file path, line/column numbers, frame
size, PC address, and more.

Clicking a stack frame will cause the "Registers & Locals" tab (if available) to
be updated to the registers and local variables of the frame.

The extent of the information available varies a bit from platform to platform.
For example, only for FreeRTOS and Zephyr MCU projects, the Threads tab will
show the status and stack usage of each thread.

For MCU projects, please refer to [this document](/docs/mcu/rtos-analysis/) to
learn more about the configuration needed to collect thread information.

## Registers & Local variables

This tab shows the registers and local variables of the currently selected stack
frame in the Threads panel. The registers and local variables are shown in a
table:

<img
  width="630"
  src="/img/docs/platform/trace-details-registers-locals.png"
  alt="trace-details-registers-locals"
/>

The colored letter in front of the name indicates the type of variable:

- A => function argument
- L => local variable
- R => CPU register

If variables/registers are not shown, it means that they were either optimized
away by the compiler or that the information is not available in the coredump.

## Memory Viewer

The Memory Viewer is a low-level view of the memory of the device at the time
the coredump was captured:

<img
  width="370"
  src="/img/docs/platform/trace-details-memory-viewer.png"
  alt="trace-details-memory-viewer"
/>

#### Navigating the Memory Viewer

To jump to an address, enter the address in either decimal or hexadecimal
notation in the "Find Address" search box.

You can also jump to an address by clicking on an address from the "Globals &
Statics" tab.

#### Inspecting Memory Regions

In the "Regions" dropdown menu, the regions of memory that have been captured in
the coredump are listed. Note that certain sections from the binary (Symbol
File) are also shown. For example `.text` are normally not captured in the
coredump, but they will appear in the Memory Viewer.

If a region of memory is present in the coredump, it will always use this data,
but if it is missing, it may fall back to the data from the Symbol File. The
Regions menu shows where the data is coming from:

  src="/img/docs/platform/trace-details-memory-viewer-regions.png"
  alt="trace-details-memory-viewer-regions"
/>

## Global & Static variables

The Globals & Statics tab can be used to inspect global and static variables at
the time the coredump was captured:

<img
  width="730"
  src="/img/docs/platform/trace-details-globals-statics.png"
  alt="trace-details-globals-statics"
/>

#### Type Casting

In some languages, it's possible to use pointer to unknown types. For example,
in C/C++ one can use the `void *` type to point to arbitrary memory. As a
programmer, you often know what type the pointer is pointing to, by inspecting
the state of the program. The UI offers a way to cast variables to a different
type.

To cast a variable to a different type, click the variable's type name (grey). A
popover will appear, prompting you to "Enter type to cast to". Start typing to
reduce the list of types and then select the type you want to cast to. By
default, single-level pointers are shown in the list. If you need double or
triple pointers, suffix your search query with `**` or `***`.

#### Downloading a variable's data

Sometimes you may want to download the raw binary data of a variable. For
example, if the coredump contains a buffer that you wish to process further on
your computer. To do this, hover over the variable's value and click the
magnifying glass that appears on the right side. A modal will appear displaying
the entire contents of the variable, as well as a "Download Binary" button to
download the contents to a file.

Note: this feature only works for fixed-size variables/arrays.

#### "Hex-dumping" a variable

By clicking the address on the right side of a variable, the Memory Viewer will
navigate the hex dump view to the memory where the variable is stored and
highlight the bytes occupied by the variable.

#### Limitations

- This feature is currently only supported for MCU coredumps.
- It only works for C/C++ code. If you need support for another language, please
  [let us know!](mailto:hello@memfault.com)
- When using type casting, the type has to be used in the source code of the
  program when it was compiled (it needs to exist in the debug info of the
  program). In other words, it is not possible to define a type layout on the
  fly in the web application.

## Heap Analysis

This view provides insight into heap allocations. This optional debugging
feature tags all heap allocations with their respective size, address, and
location of code that allocated it. Use it to understand memory distribution,
heap fragmentation, or to find memory leaks in an out-of-memory situation in the
field.

This view is only available for MCU coredumps. Please refer to the
[guide on heap allocation tracking](/docs/mcu/heap-stats/) for more information
on how to enable this feature in the MCU SDK.

## ISR Analysis

This tab shows the analysis of the Interrupt Status Registers. This currently
only works for ARM MCUs.

## MPU Analysis

The MPU Analysis tab shows the analysis of the Memory Protection Unit (MPU)
registers. Here, we tell you if the MPU is configured correctly or not, and
provide guidance on how to fix any issues we find.

This currently only works for ARM MCUs that have support for an MPU. For a
detailed explanation of the MPU and how to configure it, please refer to
[this blog article](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/fix-bugs-and-secure-firmware-with-the-mpu).
