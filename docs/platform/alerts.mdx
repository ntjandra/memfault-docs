The Alerts feature will send a notification when heartbeat events satisfy a
given threshold for a specific set of filters. To find the feature, click the
**Alerts** item in the sidebar.

## Fleet-threshold Alerts

Fleet-threshold Alerts operate on aggregate Metrics conditions. For example, you
could configure a Fleet-threshold Alert that triggers when your `production`
Cohort surpasses a mean count of 5 connection failures in a time window of one
hour.

Only [Metrics marked as Timeseries](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be
used in the condition for Fleet-threshold Alerts.

Fleet threshold alerts are evaluated every hour. You will receive a notification
if the aggregate meets the condition for data points in the preceding hour.

## Device-threshold Alerts

Device-threshold Alerts trigger when any Device reports a certain value or range
of values for a Metric.

Any [type of Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics#timeseries) can be used in the
condition for Device-threshold Alerts.

Whenever the Memfault cloud receives a
[heartbeat event with metrics](/docs/platform/metrics) from a device, it will
evaluate the applicable Device-threshold Alerts and create Incidents, if
triggered. Depending on the configuration of the Alert, notifications can be
sent immediately as an Incident starts, or as a scheduled summary of new
Incidents.

### Incidents

At most 1 incident is generated in a 24 hour period per device. This is to
minimize the number of incidents created and avoid alert fatigue. Devices can
hit a metric threshold multiple times in 24 hours without creating duplicate
incidents.

:::info

When only 1 device hits a metric threshold within the last 24 hours and reports
an alert incident, the captured date timestamp is updated once within 24 hours.
When multiple devices begin hitting the threshold for a given metric within a 24
hour period, the captured date timestamp will be updated when the new alert is
emitted.

### Creating a Device-threshold Alert

Let's create an alert when the `battery_perc` (battery percentage) is below 5%,
for devices with serial numbers starting with `MFLT`.

- Click **Alerts** in the sidebar, and **Create Alert** in the top right.
- Provide a **Title** and optional **Description** (highly advised)!
- Set a **Condition** value from a list of heartbeat metrics, or type the string
  key to find it.
  - We set the condition value to **is less than** **5**.
  - We also wanted to make sure that the **Device Serial** values start with
    `MFLT`.
  - To do this we click **(+) and condition**, and specify these values.
- Next choose which targets should receive these Alerts. Optionally, click
  "Manage targets" to navigate to the settings page to manage your targets.
- Finally, specify when to receive notifications for these alerts.
  - To be notified immediately when the alert is triggered and an incident is
    started, select "when a new incident starts".
  - To receive a summary of new incidents, select "a scheduled summary of
    incidents..." and set up your preferred schedule.
    - The timezone is prefilled according to your browser or custom timezone,
      but you can modify it as you need.
    - You can have a minimum of 1 and maximum of 4 summary schedules configured
      per alert.

- Above, we have created our Alert! Click **OK**

### Incident Details UI

Once the Alert is set up, Memfault will watch for Events matching the criteria
specified. If it finds any, it will create Incidents, which can be found by
clicking on the Alert entry in the Alerts table.

Expect alerts to be delivered in the UI almost immediately under Incidents.
Navigate to
[**Alerts**](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/alerts) and
select the Alert you want. Incidents are listed per device.
