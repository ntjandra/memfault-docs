If you encounter any issues in your data transfer implementation, Memfault has
tools to help debug!

- A UI you can use to
  [view the raw "Chunk" data payloads](/docs/mcu/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint#troubleshooting)
  that have arrived for your project.
- [Precanned Data Payloads](/docs/mcu/test-patterns-for-chunks-endpoint) you can
  pass through your `user_transport_send_chunk_data()` implementation to test
  data transfer in isolation.
- A [GDB Script](/docs/mcu/test-data-collection-with-gdb) which can be installed
  to send chunks programmatically every time a breakpoint is hit.
