This guide will cover integrating the Memfault Linux SDK into systems built with
[Yocto][yocto-homepage].

When you're done, you will have a basic integration setup that can talk to the
Memfault cloud, enabling one or more of the following features:

- Reporting reboot events to Memfault.
- Reporting [Metrics][docs-linux-metrics].
- [Over-the-air (OTA) updates][docs-linux-ota].
- [Uploading systems logs][docs-linux-logging] to Memfault.

## Useful links

- Memfault's Yocto layer [meta-memfault][source-sdk], to add Memfault to your
  build. Make sure to use the [branch matching the Yocto
  release][source-sdk-branches] that you are using.
- A [sample integration using Yocto][source-yocto-example].
- Reference documentation for:
  - `memfaultd` [Configuration file][docs-configuration].
  - [`memfaultctl` CLI][docs-memfaultctl].

## Assumptions and dependencies

- Currently, our SDK is centered around [Yocto][yocto-homepage] and is verified
  to work on these releases of Yocto:
  - [`4.0 kirkstone`][yocto-kirkstone]
  - [`3.1 dunfell`][yocto-dunfell]
- Your project uses [`systemd`][systemd-homepage] as the init system.

Optionally, as requirements of plugins:

- For [OTA][docs-linux-ota]:
  - An A/B partition scheme (two partitions for root filesystems, one active and
    one to receive the next update). Systems will typically also have a `data`
    partition which is persisted accross updates.
  - [SWUpdate][swupdate-homepage] as an OTA update client.
  - A bootloader, configured to collaborate with SWUpdate.
    [U-Boot][u-boot-homepage] is often used. The bootloader selects which root
    partition to boot from and will switch the active partition after an update.
    This setup is very system dependent and beyond the scope of this guide but
    our example layer includes SWUpdate and U-Boot configurations for QEMU and
    RaspberryPis.
- For [Custom Metrics][docs-linux-metrics]:
  - [collectd][collectd-homepage] to collect and upload metrics.
- For [Log Collection][docs-linux-logging]:
  - [fluent-bit][fluent-bit-homepage] to collect kernel and system logs.

## Add `memfaultd` to your system

:::tip

Keep [`meta-memfault-example`][source-yocto-example] open as a reference
implementation. Your integration should look similar to it once you're done
following the steps in this tutorial.

:::

The `memfaultd` service is the main orchestrator of the subsystems that conform
and are used by the Memfault Linux SDK. As with all our SDKs, its [source code
is available on GitHub][source-memfaultd].

Among its responsibilities are:

- Keeping a queue of items to be uploaded to the Memfault cloud.
- Uploading that data at a specified interval, and recovering from network
  failures using an exponential back-off system, independent of the regular
  refresh interval.
- Controlling whether data is allowed to be collected (e.g. by user consent)
  from a device or not.
- Interacting with and configuring subsystems such as SWUpdate and collectd.
- Receiving and uploading logs collected by fluent-bit.
- Providing configuration access via [memfaultctl][docs-memfaultctl]
  (`memfaultctl` is a symbolic link to `memfaultd`).

`memfaultd` is required for integration.

### Add `meta-memfault` layer and dependencies

Include the [`meta-memfault`][source-meta-memfault] layer in your
`bblayers.conf` file, alongside dependencies:

```
# Apart from other layers you may already depend on:
BBLAYERS ?= " \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-rust-bin \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/memfault-linux-sdk/meta-memfault \
    # Provides collectd (recommended) - Also a dependency of the swupdate layer:
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
"
```

`meta-memfault` requires a Rust compiler providing the `cargo` class. Version
`1.65.0` is the oldest version supported at the moment.

We recommend using the [`meta-rust-bin` layer provided by
`rust-embedded`][meta-rust-bin] as it will use a pre-built compiler and has a
minimal impact on your build times.

<details>
<summary>Other options for Rust in Yocto</summary>

There are other ways to make the Rust compiler available in your Yocto build
process:

- Built-in support for rust included in `oe-core` since since 3.4 Honister.

  This will not work with Memfault as the provided version of Rust in kirkstone
  is `1.59.0`.

- Up-to-date Rust support via `meta-rust`.

  `meta-rust` was the first layer to provide rust support in Yocto. It has now
  been replaced by the built-in support. However, it is still maintained and
  provides more recent versions of Rust for kirkstone.

  This works but requires a slightly different recipe than the one provided with
  the Memfault SDK. Please contact us if you would like to use this option.

</details>

### Use systemd as your init system

`memfaultd` currently depends on systemd to:

- restart services it cooperates with, for example, collectd and swupdate;
- detect when a reboot was requested by the user;

To use `systemd` as an init system (using `poky`), add to your `conf/local.conf`
file:

```
DISTRO_FEATURES:append = " systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES:remove = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_init_manager = "systemd"
DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED:append = "sysvinit"
VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_initscripts = ""
```

### Authorize Memfault License

Since `memfaultd` has a commercial license, you'll need to add an exception for
it, for example in your `local.conf`:

```
LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED:append = " commercial_memfaultd"
```

### (Optional) Add meta-swupdate for OTA

If you are planning on using `swupdate` for OTA, you will also need to add the
`meta-swupdate` layer:

```diff
# Apart from other layers you may already depend on:
BBLAYERS ?= " \
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/memfault-linux-sdk/meta-memfault \
    # Provides collectd (recommended) - Also a dependency of the swupdate layer:
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-openembedded/meta-oe \
// highlight-next-line
    ${YOCTOROOT}/sources/meta-swupdate \
"
```

You can grab a copy of `meta-swupdate` from [the source
repository][source-meta-swupdate]. Note that `meta-oe` is a dependency of
`meta-swupdate`.

And add the necessary dependencies to your image file (`swupdate` will be
required automatically by the `memfaultd` recipe as long as `plugin_swupdate` is
active):

```
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
    u-boot-env \
    u-boot-fw-utils \
"
```

## Minimal Configuration of `memfaultd`

### (Optional) Opt out of `memfaultd` built-in plugins

The `memfaultd` daemon has a plugin system. All plugins are included by default,
so you don't need to do anything if you want them in. However, you can control
which plugins are included at build time.

The available plugins are:

- `swupdate`: used for [OTA management][docs-linux-ota].
- `collectd`: used for collection of [metrics][docs-linux-metrics].
- `coredump`: used for collection of [coredumps][docs-linux-coredumps].
- `logging`: used to [collect and upload][docs-linux-logging] logs.

Set `PACKAGECONFIG` for the `memfaultd` package to control which plugins are
included in the `memfaultd` build. For example, you can add a
`memfaultd.bbappend` recipe with the following contents:

```
PACKAGECONFIG := "plugin_swupdate plugin_collectd plugin_coredump plugin_logging"
```

Alternatively, in your `local.conf` file:

```
PACKAGECONFIG:pn_memfaultd := "plugin_swupdate plugin_collectd plugin_coredump plugin_logging"
```

### Add a `memfault-device-info` executable to your build {#memfault-device-info}

:::tip

You may want to copy over [the entire `memfault-device-info` recipe from our
examples][source-yocto-memfault-device-info-example] to get started. Make sure
to edit its contents following the steps in this section.

:::

The `memfaultd` daemon expects to find a `memfault-device-info` executable in
`$PATH`. The `memfault-device-info` executable is created by you during
integration and is meant to provide device-specific information in order to
identify it in Memfault services. The expected output is in the following
format:

```
MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=<device-id>
MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=<hardware-version>
```

Read more about [Device ID][docs-device-id], [Software Versions, and Hardware
Versions][docs-hardware-version-software-version] to better understand these
core Memfault platform concepts.

Here's an example `memfault-device-info` shell script one might add to
`/usr/bin/memfault-device-info`:

```shell
#!/bin/sh
echo MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=$(cat /etc/machine-id)
echo MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=$(dmidecode -s system-product-name)
```

The script would output something like this:

```shell
$ memfault-device-info
MEMFAULT_DEVICE_ID=4a7d5d74-e8f0-471f-9f8c-23e3dd5ce18c
MEMFAULT_HARDWARE_VERSION=some-board-rev-1.3
```

If you added a recipe named `memfault-device-info`, don't forget to add it to
your image dependencies:

```diff
IMAGE_INSTALL:append = " \
//highlight-next-line
    memfault-device-info \
    u-boot-env \
    u-boot-fw-utils \
"
```

### Add `/etc/memfaultd.conf` to your build

:::tip

Find a [full reference on `/etc/memfaultd.conf` here][docs-configuration]. You
may want to copy over the entire [`memfaultd.bbappend` recipe from our
examples][source-yocto-memfaultd-conf-example] to get started. Make sure to edit
its contents following the steps in this section.

:::

A [default `memfaultd.conf`][source-builtin-conf] (called `builtin.conf` in the
source files) is embedded within the `memfaultd` binary, and the daemon will
fall back to it if `/etc/memfaultd.conf` does not provide an override for a
specific key. All values in it can be overwritten by adding an
`/etc/memfaultd.conf` file to your build, e.g. using a `bbappends` recipe for
`memfaultd` (see an [example][source-yocto-memfaultd-conf-example]). You may
copy parts of the built-in config (or the whole file) to customize configuration
on your target device.

Note that while the sample file has reasonable defaults for most keys, it cannot
guess a value for some fields such as `software_version`, `software_type` or
`project_key`. Hence, a minimal `/etc/memfaultd.conf` file should look like
this:

```json
{
  "software_version": "1.0.0",
  "software_type": "main",
  "project_key": "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>"
}
```

Note that `/etc/memfaultd.conf` is designed to be in a read-only filesystem.

Read more about [Software Versions and Hardware
Versions][docs-hardware-version-software-version] to better understand these
core Memfault platform concepts.

### Configure a persistent storage directory for `memfaultd`

In `/etc/memfaultd.conf`:

```json
{
  "software_version": "1.0.0",
  "software_type": "main",
  "project_key": "<YOUR_PROJECT_KEY>",
  // highlight-next-line
  "data_dir": "<YOUR_PERSISTENT_STORAGE_DIR>"
}
```

By default it will be a directory in `/media`. You will most likely need to
change this to wherever your device stores data in a persistent manner.
Requirements for this directory are:

- That it is writable to by `memfaultd`.
- That its data persists after firmware upgrades.

Your `data_dir` will be read from or written to for the following reasons:

- It will be read every [`refresh_interval_seconds`][docs-configuration], in
  order to check the status of the queue,
- written to whenever an event occurs that we track in that queue, such as
  reboot events and when a coredump is captured (see [Linux
  Coredumps][docs-linux-coredumps]), and
- written to whenever configuration is changed at runtime, for example by using
  `memfaultctl {enable,disable}-data-collection` (see
  ["Set `enable_data_collection`"](#set-enable_data_collection)).

Note that the [`collectd_plugin.interval_seconds`][docs-configuration] does not
affect reads or writes to `data_dir`, unless you've configured collectd to write
there, too. By default, collectd will store metrics in memory.

See our [configuration reference][docs-configuration] for more context.

### Set `enable_data_collection`

By default, `enable_data_collection` is `false` (see the [default
configuration][source-builtin-conf]). This is to enable asking end users for
consent before collecting or transmitting any data to Memfault services.

Once the end user has given their consent, you can enable data collection like
so:

```shell
$ memfaultctl enable-data-collection
```

To disable it:

```shell
$ memfaultctl disable-data-collection
```

The `memfaultd` service will restart automatically whenever you run either of
those commands if called with a value different from the current configuration.

Take a look at the [`/etc/memfaultd.conf` reference][docs-configuration] for
more information.

:::tip

To always enable data collection you can include the key
`enable_data_collection` with the value `true` in your configuration file.

## Test the integration

<p>
  You can test your integration by rebooting your test device. Then, on the
  Memfault app, open{" "}
  <ProjectMagicLink path="/devices">
    <b>Fleet -> Devices</b>
  </ProjectMagicLink>{" "}
  and check that your device shows up. If you open the specific device, you
  should be able to find its reboot events under the <b>Reboots</b> tab.
</p>

## Integration next-steps

Congratulations! 🎉 Memfault is running in your product. You will start getting
useful insights automatically.

To get more value from Memfault, we recommend the following steps.

### Reboot reasons

Memfault will automatically classify some reboots such as kernel panics, user
triggered reboot and OTA updates.

For other reboot reasons that are specific to your product, you can inform
`memfaultd` before restarting the system. Memfault Dashboard will then give you
an accurate picture of why your devices are restarting.

Our [Reboot Reason Tracking Guide][docs-linux-reboot] presents several
mechanisms to do this.

### Coredumps

`memfaultd` will automatically configure the kernel to capture coredumps and
upload them to Memfault.

Follow our [Coredumps Guide][docs-linux-coredumps] to upload debug symbols to
Memfault during your build process. This is required for Memfault coredump
analysis to work.

### Metrics

By default, `collectd` will capture system metrics and provide an overview of
how the system is doing.

Our [Metrics Guide][docs-linux-metrics] explains how to collect custom
application-specific metrics from your system.

### Logging

If you have enabled `plugin_logging`, `fluent-bit` will capture kernel and
system logs and upload them to Memfault.

You can customize which logs are captured, filter out some lines and capture
data from other sources (file on disk, serial port, etc). Refer to our [Linux
Logging Guide][docs-linux-logging].

### OTA

A working OTA setup will require collaboration between the bootloader, the
updater (for example `swupdate`) and `memfaultd`. You will also need to
configure your build process to generate update images in a format compatible
with the updater.

Follow our [Embedded Linux OTA Integration Guide][docs-linux-ota] to configure
and use OTA.
