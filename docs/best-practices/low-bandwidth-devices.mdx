title: Using Memfault with Low-Bandwidth Devices
sidebar_label: Low-Bandwidth Devices
---

IoT devices are being deployed all over the world, and many of these devices are
connected to the internet using a variety of network topologies including
options like LTE, LoRaWAN, and satellite connectivity. Without a standard Wi-Fi
connection, bandwidth is often constrained and metered by a network carrier.
Many devices are bandwidth-constrained due to the cost of each kilobyte sent or
received, and some devices are further limited by the intermittent availability
of their network source. Device battery requirements also can constrain
bandwidth budgets.

Memfault was built from the ground up to handle devices with limited bandwidth,
intermittent connectivity, and minimal processing power capabilities. Today,
Memfault is being used successfully in bandwidth-constrained environments, and
some customers are successfully using the service while restricted to 400 bytes
per day!

In this article, we'll cover how to tune Memfault's SDK, and use the platform to
effectively operate bandwidth-constrained IoT devices. **Following these best
practices will better equip IoT operators in their efforts to reduce network
costs and device power consumption**. We'll focus primarily on covering the
setup for MCU-based devices since these fleets are more commonly limited in
connectivity. This guidance is generally applicable to other supported platforms
as well.

## Built for Low-Bandwidth Device Operations

Memfault's platform architecture can handle devices with access to limited
network bandwidth.

### Efficient Device Data Collection

Device data is collected using
[Event serialization](/docs/mcu/event-serialization-overview) combined with RLE
(Run-length encoding) compression which minimizes payload size in transit.

### Multi-day Chunk Uploads

The Memfault SDK splits the collected data into chunks prior to transport.
Chunks prepared for Memfault are buffered on the device. If a chunk upload
begins and cannot be completed during the initial connection, devices will queue
the remaining chunks and continue uploading them when reconnected to the
network. This is a default behavior of the SDK. It's especially useful for
scenarios where network bandwidth is constrained and connectivity is unstable.
You can read more about how data is sent to Memfault in
[Data from Firmware to the Cloud](/docs/mcu/data-from-firmware-to-the-cloud).

## Enable Low-Bandwidth Platform Features

Memfault provides a variety of features that can accommodate devices with
bandwidth constraints. These are best practices crafted from working with
customers who have deployed low-bandwidth devices in the field.

### Use Compact Logs

Compact logs control whether human-readable ASCII logs are persisted or whether
Memfault's compact log system is used. **Enabling compact logs will save up to
85% of log data usage.** Follow the guide on
[Enabling Compact Logs](/docs/mcu/compact-logs) if you want to collect logs more
efficiently without disabling them entirely.

### Optimizing Coredump Collection

Coredumps provide valuable insights for developers while troubleshooting device
faults and asserts, such as stack traces and register values. Below are a few
modifications available for capturing coredumps more efficiently.

#### Reduce Coredump Size

While useful, [Coredump](/docs/mcu/coredumps) collection can inflate network
expenses due to the average size of a coredump. Memfault addresses these
concerns by providing control over coredump size. Ideally, you can shrink the
average size of a coredump to around 512 bytes. Follow the guidelines available
in
[choosing what to store in a coredump](/docs/mcu/coredumps#choosing-what-to-store-in-a-coredump)
for configuring what data should be included in coredumps.

Fundamentally, nothing about your Memfault user experience changes when
collecting smaller coredumps. You will still see issues generated with coredump
data included and logs flowing from the device. This doesn't change even if you
chose a more constrained integration path and did not store all device RAM. To
see a debugging session in action, watch
[Memfault 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZSSrRe9nkA).

:::info

The primary tradeoff here is reduced data resolution. There may be device issues
where having additional context in the coredump is useful for debugging
purposes.

:::

#### Coredump Sampling

Collecting data from a percentage of diagnostic events occurring in the field
using a sampling mechanism will reduce the volume of coredumps sent to Memfault.
This involves implementing custom sampling functionality in your firmware so
devices send a configurable percentage of coredumps. That way engineers can
still access device issues while consuming less bandwidth.

### Use Metrics Selectively

[Metrics](/docs/platform/metrics/) are a great way to monitor devices. Each
metric you collect increases payload size by between 6-8 bytes. Collecting
metrics selectively will decrease the amount of bandwidth your fleet requires
while giving you insights about overall device health.

Check out the
[power of metrics webinar](https://go.memfault.com/webinar-power-of-metrics-monitoring-battery-life-connectivity-power-consumption)
for a more detailed overview of metrics Memfault recommends to track.

### Use OTA Delta Releases

If you're using Memfault OTA and you need firmware update binaries to be as
small as possible, using Delta Releases is a potential strategy. However, they
come with additional complexities and it's worth carefully considering whether
they are worth it. Get more in-depth coverage from our docs on
[Delta Releases](/docs/platform/ota/#delta-releases). You can also check out a
post on Interrupt about
[OTA delta updates](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/ota-delta-updates).

## Recommended Bandwidth Optimized Device Configurations

Memfault's SDK can be tuned for achieving minimal data collection:

1. Collect Network Utilization Metrics In Heartbeats
2. Set a longer
   [Heartbeat](/docs/mcu/embedded-self-serve/#define-first-heartbeat) interval
   of 6+ hours
3. Reduce the number of [Metrics](/docs/mcu/metrics-api) pulled from devices
4. Verify `MEMFAULT_EVENT_INCLUDE_DEVICE_SERIAL` is disabled
5. Verify `MEMFAULT_DATA_SOURCE_RLE_ENABLED` is enabled
6. Increase minimum logging level `MEMFAULT_RAM_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`
7. Disable Coredump Collection

Take a look at the default configuration
[`default_config.h`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/7d3396b26f1c161f1c288b6bd39676ec16ebda67/components/include/memfault/default_config.h).
Familiarizing yourself with the standard config, or minimally knowing one exists
and where to find it, is helpful.

:::info

Remember, apply these best practices based on your specific bandwidth
constraints.

:::

Let's walk through the recommended configurations:

:::info

This assumes you've already integrated the Memfault SDK.

:::

### Collect Network Utilization Metrics In Heartbeats

One metric to make sure to collect is overall network usage, especially if
bandwidth is metered. Collecting device network activity can help quickly
identify regressions in increased data collection on a per-device basis.
Memfault can help with this. One of the
[recommended heartbeat metrics](/docs/mcu/da1469x-sdk-guide/#define-first-heartbeat-metric)
worth tracking is data efficiency. Let's step through an example of how to add a
metric tracking network bytes being transported in and out of a device using LTE
as the primary network transport:

#### Modify your heartbeat config

##### memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def

Tracking the network bytes being transported to and from the device provides
operators with insight into their data flow.

```c
//! @file memfault_metrics_heartbeat_config.def
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(LteNetworkBytesIn, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned)
MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY_DEFINE(LteNetworkBytesOut, kMemfaultMetricType_Unsigned)

```

#### Instrument your firmware with the new transport metrics

Include the metrics instrumentation code supplied by Memfault's SDK in code
paths where data is being sent or received over the network.

```c
#include "memfault/metrics/metrics.h"
// [ ... ]
void lte_radio_send_bytes(const void *data, size_t data_len) {
  // [ ... code to send LTE data ... ]
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_add(MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(LteNetworkBytesOut), data_len);
}

void lte_radio_receive_bytes(const void *data, size_t received_data_len) {
  // [ ... code to receive data over LTE]
  memfault_metrics_heartbeat_add(MEMFAULT_METRICS_KEY(LteNetworkBytesIn), received_data_len);
}
```

#### Verify heartbeat includes data transport metrics

After deploying the new software version with new metrics configured, view the
[Events Debug](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/events) log
and open a `heartbeat`. The heartbeat should contain `LteNetworkBytesOut` and
`LteNetworkBytesIn` key-value pairs if the instrumented code paths have been
called. Refer to
[Data Transfer Troubleshooting](/docs/troubleshooting/data-transfer-troubleshooting)
if you don't see any values in the metrics payload.

### Increase Heartbeat Interval

By default, heartbeats are collected every 3600 seconds. Decreasing the
frequency of heartbeats saves bandwidth without sacrificing data accuracy. For
example, if hourly heartbeats are used and 1000 bytes are sent every hour over
an LTE radio, each heartbeat will have a value of 1000 for `LteNetworkBytesOut`.
If daily heartbeats are used, then the hearbeat value for `LteNetworkBytesOut`
will be 24000 bytes. The quality of the data remains the same even when the
resolution is decreased.

Let's modify the collection interval to 6 hours.

Add the following to your project's `memfault_platform_config.h`:

##### memfault_platform_config.h

```c
//! @file memfault_platform_config

#define MEMFAULT_METRICS_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_SECS 21600
```

:::info

Before removing any metrics or disabling collection entirely, consider
increasing the heartbeat interval to 24+ hours. It's preferable to reduce
heartbeat collection interval over removing useful metric values. They're a very
efficient way to provide device information.

:::

Note that the 6-hour collection interval is a guideline. Adjust based on your
use case. Take a look at the article
[monitoring fleet health with heartbeat metrics](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/device-heartbeat-metrics)
on Interrupt.

### Verify `MEMFAULT_EVENT_INCLUDE_DEVICE_SERIAL` is disabled

Omitting the device serial from each event saves between 10-20 bytes per
payload. This is disabled by default in the Memfault SDK configuration. If it
has been modified, remove the configuration from your
`memfault_platform_config.h` file to use the default configuration value
disabling event serial inclusion.

### Verify `MEMFAULT_DATA_SOURCE_RLE_ENABLED` is enabled

Run-length Encoding (RLE) compresses data on the fly which improves efficiency
when device data is in transit. This is enabled by default in the Memfault SDK
configuration. If it has been modified, remove the configuration from your
`memfault_platform_config.h` file to use the default configuration value
enabling data source RLE.

:::info

Enabling RLE means you can't use
[Async Data Source Mode](/docs/mcu/data-source-async-access).

:::

### Increase minimum logging level `MEMFAULT_RAM_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MIN_LOG_LEVEL`

Increasing the minimum logging level will increase the minimum log severity
that's buffered by the Memfault Logging component. Depending on a particular
system's logging setup, this can make better use of the log buffer space when
that's captured as part of a coredump. We recommend collecting only warning and
error logs when device bandwidth is limited. The exact collection level and
instrumentation will depend on your logging implementation. You can learn more
about how Memfault collects logs in the [docs](/docs/mcu/logging/).

```c
//! @file memfault_platform_config

//! Controls default log level that will be saved to https://mflt.io/logging
#ifndef MEMFAULT_RAM_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MIN_LOG_LEVEL
#define MEMFAULT_RAM_LOGGER_DEFAULT_MIN_LOG_LEVEL kMemfaultPlatformLogLevel_Warning
#endif
```

Note the technical tradeoff of reduced log collection is limiting the
availability of useful context when debugging device issues.

### Disable Coredump Collection

:::warning

We recommend collecting coredumps whenever possible. Use this suggestion in very
specific situations when your devices have extremely limited bandwidth.

:::

Removing different data types such as coredumps from the Memfault packetizer
saves precious bytes being transmitted each time a device sends data to
Memfault. Use the data packetizer mask `kMfltDataSourceMask_Event` for only
collecting the lightweight data sources (reboots, heartbeats, trace events).
This configuration is only set at runtime. Modify any instances you're using the
[utility API](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/d7ed96dabb9fbdb73efd65f895950a17b496b84a/CHANGES.md#chart_with_upwards_trend-improvements-32)
`memfault_packetizer_set_active_sources()`:

```c
memfault_packetizer_set_active_sources(kMfltDataSourceMask_Event);
```

Coredumps will still be saved on the device. Disabling this configuration only
ensures coredumps are not sent to Memfault. When you have physical access to the
device you'll still be able to review coredumps. Check out more info in the
[`data_packetizer.h`](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk/blob/d7ed96dabb9fbdb73efd65f895950a17b496b84a/components/include/memfault/core/data_packetizer.h)
file.

## Debugging Low-Bandwidth Devices

Now that we've established different Memfault methods that effectively reduce
data collection, let's evaluate how these configurations provide valuable data
for fixing an issue on a bandwidth-constrained device. Importantly, we've
established that even with limited bandwidth, Memfault can collect essential
diagnostic data including coredumps, metrics, and logs.

### Track Data Usage with Metric Charts

Viewing metrics on the Memfault dashboard is useful for quickly spotting trends
in fleet bandwidth usage. Navigate to the
[Metric Chart](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/metrics?newMetricChart)
and create the following charts:

1. Aggregate the mean of metric `LteNetworkBytesOut`.
2. Aggregate the mean of metric `LteNetworkBytesIn`.

Here's an example of the metric chart configuration:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-low-bandwidth/lte-network-metrics-config-modal.png"
    alt="LteNetworkBytesOut metrics chart aggregate of mean configuration."
  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-low-bandwidth/lte-network-usage-metric-charts.png"
    alt="LTE Network metrics charts."
  />
</p>

Between firmware updates, network consumption regressions are common. Tracking
these metrics will highlight historical changes in bandwidth consumption.
Combined with threshold alerts, metric dashboards are powerful tools for
analyzing device performance across different software versions. When a new
version is deployed, developers can monitor these dashboards and alerts for
anomalous network consumption. This analysis becomes even more interesting when
leveraging Memfault's OTA. You can create a new release and activate a
[staged rollout](/docs/platform/ota/#staged-rollout-of-a-release). This allows
for more confident testing of new software versions on a percentage of devices
in the field. If the new version contains code causing an increase in network
utilization, the version rollout can be reverted without the entire fleet being
impacted by the issue.

### Get alerted on high data usage with Alerts

Developers monitoring device health want observability notifications covering
different network-related changes. For example, if a device is limited to using
10 megabytes per month, but the metric `LteNetworkBytesOut` is reporting 1
megabyte per day, something isn't right. The engineers responsible for device
monitoring want to know about this issue immediately. Memfault combines metric
values with
[Device-threshold Alerts](/docs/platform/alerts/#device-threshold-alerts).
Developers can receive notifications whenever a device reports a specified value
or range of values.

To add a Device-threshold Alert, Navigate to your
[Alerts](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/alerts?new). Let's
configure 2 alerts that are triggered when:

1. The metric `LteNetworkBytesOut` is greater than your network bandwidth upper
   bound for egress traffic.
2. The metric `LteNetworkBytesIn` is greater than your expected network
   bandwidth upper bound for ingress traffic.

Here's an example of the alert configuration:

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-low-bandwidth/lte-network-bytes-out-device-alert-modal.png"
    alt="LteNetworkBytesOut Device-threshold alert creation."
  />
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img
    width="800"
    src="/img/docs/best-practices/mcu-low-bandwidth/lte-network-usage-device-alerts.png"
    alt="Device-threshold alerts for tracking network bytes usage."
  />
</p>

Whenever a device exceeds these thresholds, developers will get a notification
and can jump into finding the root cause of the spike in bandwidth usage.
Moreover, you can use these alerts to pinpoint outlier devices consuming more
bandwidth than the average device in a fleet.
