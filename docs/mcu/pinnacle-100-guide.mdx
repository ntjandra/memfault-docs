In this guide we will walk through the steps for integrating the
[Memfault Firmware SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) into
any project using
[Laird's Pinnacle™ 100 Cellular Modem](https://www.lairdconnect.com/wireless-modules/cellular-solutions/pinnacle-100-cellular-lte-m-nb-iot-bluetooth-5-modem)
(i.e
[Sentrius™ MG100](https://www.lairdconnect.com/iot-devices/iot-gateways/sentrius-mg100-gateway-lte-mnb-iot-and-bluetooth-5)).

:::tip

The Pinnacle-100-Firmware has built-in support for the Memfault Firmware SDK.
Laird Connectivity has released some
[excellent documentation](https://lairdcp.github.io/guides/ble-gateway-firmware/1.0/docs/memfault.html)
on how to integrate Memfault and the
[AWS Out-of-Box demo](https://lairdcp.github.io/guides/ble-gateway-firmware/1.0/docs/readme_aws.html)
includes a full Memfault integration that can be tried out. We recommend
following both this documentation page as well as Laird's.

:::

Upon completion of the integration, the following subcomponents will be added to
your system!

- [Reboot Reason Tracking](/docs/mcu/reboot-reason-tracking)
- [Error Tracking with Trace Events](/docs/mcu/trace-events)
- [RAM-backed stack dump Collection](/docs/mcu/coredumps)

## Integration Steps

This tutorial assumes you have a working environment for building the
[Pinnacle 100 Firmware](https://github.com/LairdCP/Pinnacle-100-Firmware-Manifest)
(such as an an application based on the
[AWS Out-of-Box Demo](https://lairdcp.github.io/guides/ble-gateway-firmware/1.0/docs/readme_aws.html)

## Create a Memfault Account

The integration requires a Memfault cloud account to process data collected by
the Memfault Firmware SDK. You can create one
[for free from here](https://goto.memfault.com/create-key/pinnacle-100)!

## Update Kconfig selections in prj.conf {#kconfig-section}

Add the following options to your system's `prj.conf`:

```bash
# Project-specific configuration settings

CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_PROJECT_KEY="YOUR_PROJECT_KEY"
CONFIG_MEMFAULT_NCS_FW_TYPE="pinnacle-fw"
```

## Upload Symbol File

<UploadSymbolFile />

## Publish data to the Memfault cloud

<EnableServerSideDeveloperMode />

### HTTPS

The integration will automatically push data to Memfault over HTTPS when an LTE
connection becomes available prior to connecting to AWS IoT allowing one to
immediately get information about unexpected resets as well as debug any
connectivity issues with AWS IoT.

### MQTT

After a connection with AWS IoT is established, Memfault data is published to
the following topic.

<MqttTopic />

<MqttAws />
