## Introduction

In order to process uploaded data, such as coredumps, Memfault needs to be able
to find the Symbol File (ELF) that corresponds to the software that produced the
uploaded data. Without an exact match, Memfault will not be able to decode the
uploaded data.

To that end, the SDK adds metadata to the uploaded data to identify the software
that produced the data. Likewise, any Symbol File that is uploaded to Memfault,
must have that same identifying metadata.

## Identifier Types

There are 3 types of identifiers:

|                                                                          | Memfault Build Id | GNU Build Id | Software Type & Version |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| Example                                                                  | `a1e688...`       | `a1e688...`  | `wifi-fw`/`1.0.0`       |
| Automatically generated hash                                             | ✅                | ✅           |
| Manually chosen                                                          |                   |              | ✅                      |
| Compiler requirement                                                     |                   | GNU/gcc      |                         |
| ID embedded inside ELF                                                   | ✅                | ✅           |
| ID passed manually upon Symbol File upload                               |                   |              | ✅                      |
| Requires running Python script to post-process ELF                       | ✅                |              |
| Minimum [SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) version | 0.20.0            | 0.20.0       |                         |

We recommend using either the Memfault Build Id or GNU Build Id option. The
Build Ids are automatically generated based on the contents of the ELF file.

Software Type & Version identifiers are manually assigned and therefore
error-prone.

:::tip

When uploading a Symbol File (ELF) that has a Build Id embedded, it is possible
to add a Software Type & Version based identifier, _in addition to the embedded
Build Id_. This will link the Symbol File with the Software Version. That way,
you can later look up and download the Symbol File by Software Version through
the Software Versions UI in Memfault.

Note that for the purpose of finding a Symbol File to match uploaded data, the
Build Id always takes precedence over Software Type & Version.

## Adding Build Ids

:::note

In order to use Build Ids for identification of Symbol Files & uploaded data,
[SDK](https://github.com/memfault/memfault-firmware-sdk) version 0.20.0 or newer
is required.

## Uploading Symbol Files using Memfault CLI {#upload-symbol-files-cli}

Please follow
[the instructions to install the Memfault CLI tool](/docs/ci/install-memfault-cli)
first.

### Uploading Symbol File with Build Id

Because the Build Id is embedded inside the ELF file, the Build Id is
automatically recognized and extracted and does not need to be passed as an
argument to the `memfault` tool:

```bash
memfault --org-token $ORG_TOKEN --org acme-inc --project smart-sink \
  upload-mcu-symbols \
  build/symbols.elf
```

:::note

<details>
  <summary>If you are using Link-Time Optimization in your build, you may get an
error when uploading the symbol file</summary>

Using
[link-time optimization (`-flto`)](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/best-and-worst-gcc-clang-compiler-flags#-flto)
can cause the symbol upload to fail:

```plaintext
ERROR: main-with-lto.elf: Build Id missing. Specify --software-version and
--software-type options or add a Build Id (see https://mflt.io/symbol-file-build-ids)
Usage: memfault upload-mcu-symbols [OPTIONS] PATH

Error: Upload failed!
```

`-flto` can inline the contents of the build id variable, removing the symbol
from the executable. To work around this, add this flag to the linker args:

`-Wl,--require-defined=g_memfault_build_id`

</details>

:::

### Uploading Symbol File with Software Type & Version

To associate a Software Type & Software Version with a Symbol File, the
`--software-type` and `--software-version` arguments need to be passed to the
`memfault` tool.

Optionally, a `--revision` (Git commit hash, SVN revision, etc) can be passed as
well to store the version control revision in the newly created Software
Version.

```bash
memfault --org-token $ORG_TOKEN --org acme-inc --project smart-sink \
  upload-mcu-symbols \
  --software-type stm32-fw \
  --software-version 1.0.0-alpha \
  --revision 89335ffade90ff7697e2ce5238bd4c68978b6d6e \
  build/symbols.elf
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### When using a Build ID, is it okay if there is not always a 1:1 mapping with Software Version?

Yes, in fact this is one of the benefits of using Build IDs. In this scenario
there will always be a 1:1 mapping between the **binary running** and a **Build
ID** so Memfault is guaranteed to recover accurate stack traces while at the
same time giving you flexibility around how you report software versions

Two common situations where there is not a 1:1 mapping are the following:

- "Dev" builds -- Memfault recommends using semver and for pre-release debug
  builds using a common software version (i.e 1.1.1-dev). This way all the
  crashes and issues observed during debug get bucketed under a single version
  that's easy to track in the UI. In this situation you wind up with many
  separate Build ID mapping to a single SoftwareVersion
- In some systems, such as
  [Nordic NRF5 SDK DFU packaging](https://infocenter.nordicsemi.com/index.jsp?topic=%2Fsdk_nrf5_v17.0.2%2Flib_bootloader_dfu_validation.html&cp=9_5_0_3_5_1_1_1&anchor=lib_bootloader_dfu_init_versions),
  multiple Software Versions can map to the same Symbol File (via Build ID),
  because the Software Version in the device is not stored within the
  application binary, so it does not impact the Symbol File (and corresponding
  Build ID).
