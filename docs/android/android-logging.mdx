Memfault [Caliper](android-bort#memfault-caliper) collects logs from every
logcat buffer. Logs are uploaded when they overlap a trace event, and are
associated with the trace.

Log files collected by Caliper are scrubbed on-device before being uploaded. See
[Data Scrubbing](android-data-scrubbing)

:::info

Logs can also be collected via bug reports - but this is not recommended.

## Configuration

Configure logging on the
[Project Settings page under **Data Sources**](https://app.memfault.com/organizations/-/projects/-/settings/data-sources).

### Kernel Oopses

Kernel Oopses are extracted from log files to create traces.

## Caliper Logging Modes

### Periodic

The default behavior (available since Bort 3.3.0). Bort will collect logcat from
all buffers at a regular interval (15 minutes).

In the case of log buffer expiry (if log buffers are too small, or if the device
has particularly spammy logging), it is possible that some logs may be missed.

### Continuous

:::info

Continuous logging mode is a preview feature, available from Bort 4.3.0 onward.

Any devices running an older version of Bort will continue to use Periodic mode
even if **Continuous** is enabled under project settings.

:::

This mode is designed to avoid missing logs due to buffer expiry.

The `MemfaultDumpster` system service continuously reads from all log buffers.
`--wrap` mode is used, so that logs are only written to disk on buffer expiry or
timeout (i.e. the service is not continuously writing logs to disk).

The **Flush To Storage** setting controls the maximum period before logs are
flushed to disk if no buffers have expired. This does not affect how log files
are chunked for upload.

Log upload works the same way as for **Periodic**.

## Log Collection

:::info

Log Collection feature is available from
[Bort 4.2.0](https://github.com/memfault/bort/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v420---september-14th-2022)
onward.

:::

Log Collection allows you to collect logs from a small set of devices, even when
there is not an event of interest, such as a crash. In addition to continuous
retrieval of logs, when combined with
[Fleet Sampling](/docs/platform/fleet-sampling#log-collection), it's possible to
fetch past logs that haven't been sent to Memfault from devices.

When logs are captured, the timezone of the logs are set to UTC rather than
device timezone. You will notice this when downloading the raw logs from a
device's logfiles tab. If you view the logs via the Memfault Log Viewer, they
will be displayed in the timezone currently selected in the Timezone Selector
(default: browser timezone).
